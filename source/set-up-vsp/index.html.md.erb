# Set up the Verify Service Provider

The first step in connecting to GOV.UK Verify is setting up the service provider locally.

The service provider allows you to send and receive messages from the GOV.UK Verify hub.

Your service provider must be able to handle a number of scenarios. You can test this using the Compliance Tool.

The GOV.UK Verify team will ask about Compliance Test results ahead of connecting to the Integration environment.
