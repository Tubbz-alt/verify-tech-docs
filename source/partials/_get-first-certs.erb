# Get certificates

To use the <%= env %> environment, you must generate self-signed certificates for your Verify Service Provider (VSP). You must generate separate self-signed certificates for:

- encryption
- signing

## Generating self-signed certificates

<%= partial "partials/get-self-signed-certificates", locals: locals %>

## Storing private keys

You must store private key files in a secure environment. Typical controls include:

- restricting private key access to approved staff
- storing files in encrypted format
- storing files offline, for example, on an encrypted USB memory stick kept in a safe
- never sharing private keys outside the environment where you created them
