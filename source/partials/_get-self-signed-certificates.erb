Use your preferred method to generate a new private key and self-signed certificate pair. 

Make sure the private key is [PKCS #8](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5208) formatted with a `.pk8` extension.

The self-signed certificate must be:

- valid for one year
- in [X.509](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4158) format and PEM encoded with a `.crt` extension

 You can use [OpenSSL][openssl-github] to generate your keys and self-signed certificates. Most Linux distributions and Mac OS versions have OpenSSL installed.

Generate your private key and self-signed certificate:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -nodes -sha256 \
   -keyout <private-key>.pk8 -out <certificate>.crt
```
     
The terminal will prompt you for information. You must provide a `Common Name`. All other information is optional.

The `Common Name` is the part of the certificate metadata that helps you identify that certificate more easily. You will see the value you entered for `Common Name` in the user interface for the GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service when you check if you uploaded the right certificate.

`Common Name` must not contain underscores.
     
There is no mandatory naming convention for `Common Name`, but you may find it useful to include the:
     
* name of your service
* name of the component the certificate is for
* environment name you generated the certificate for
* certificate type, for example signing or encryption
* version number for your certificate
