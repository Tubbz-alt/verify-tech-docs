Use your preferred method to generate the new private key and self-signed certificate pair, but make sure the files are:

- PKCS#8 formatted keys `.pk8`
- PEM encoded X509 certificates `.crt`

We recommend you establish a naming convention for all your PKI files. Typically, this includes the name of the component and an incremental version number.
