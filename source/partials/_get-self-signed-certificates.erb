Use your preferred method to generate a new private key and self-signed certificate pair, but make sure:

* the private key is PKCS#8 formatted with a `.pk8` extension
* the self-signed certificate is in X509 format and PEM encoded with a `.crt` extension

  You can use [OpenSSL][openssl-github] to generate your keys and self-signed certificates. Most Linux distributions and Mac OS versions have OpenSSL installed.

  Generate your private key and self-signed certificate valid for 1 year:

  ```sh
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout <private-key-file-name>.pk8 -out <certificate-file-name>.crt -days 365 -nodes -sha256 -subj "/C=GB/ST=County/L=City/O=Organisation/OU=Service/CN=service-production-component-encryption-4"
  ```

  where:

  * `C` is your 2-letter country code, for example `GB` for Great Britain
  * `ST` is your county, for example Swansea
  * `L` is your city or town, for example Swansea
  * `O` is the name of your organisation, for example DVLA
  * `OU` is the name of your service, for example 'View your driving licence'
  * `CN` is the common name for your certificate

  The common name, `CN`, is the part of the certificate metadata that helps you identify that certificate more easily. For example, you can see your value for `CN` in the user interface for the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool when you check if you uploaded the right certificate.

  `CN` must not contain underscores.

  There is no mandatory naming convention for `CN`, but you may find it useful to include:

  * the name of your service
  * the name of the component the certificate is for
  * the environment name you generated the certificate for
  * the type of certificate, for example signing or encryption
  * a version number for your certificate
