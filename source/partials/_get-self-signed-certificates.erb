Use your preferred method to generate the new private key and self-signed certificate pair, but make sure the files are:

- PKCS#8 formatted keys `.pk8` **TODO: IS THIS STILL A REQUIREMENT??**
- PEM encoded X509 certificates `.crt`

We recommend you establish a naming convention for all your PKI files. Typically, this includes the name of the component and an incremental version number.

For example, you can use OpenSSL to generate your keys and self-signed certificates. Most Linux distributions and Mac OS versions have OpenSSL installed.

You can then generate your private key and self-signed certificate:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout vsp-signing-2020.key -out vsp-signing-2020.crt -days 365
```

The command generates an RSA private key named `vsp-signing-2020.key` and an X509 self-signed certificate valid for 1 year named `vsp-signing-2020.crt`.
