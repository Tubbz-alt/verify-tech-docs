# Get environment access

The <%= env %> environment contains a secure, fully-working deployment of the GOV.UK Verify Hub.

<% if env == "Integration" %>
  GOV.UK Verify maintains the <%= env %> environment and it allows you to test your prototype service with dummy user data.
<% end %>

<% if env == "Production" %>
  Production allows you to connect your fully-developed beta or live service with real user data. The production environment is where you deploy your live end-to-end service. It's a restricted environment for security reasons.
<% end %>

You must [complete a short form](https://verify-environment-access.cloudapps.digital/) with information about your service so the GOV.UK Verify team can set up the <%= env %>  environment for you. This can take up to 5 working days.

<% if env == "Integration" %>
  Youâ€™ll need to submit a separate form when you connect to the Production environment.
<% end %>
