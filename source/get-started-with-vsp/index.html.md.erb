# Get started with the Verify Service Provider

The first step in connecting to GOV.UK Verify is setting up a service provider locally.

The service provider allows you to send SAML messages to the Verify Hub and receive SAML responses in return.

The service provider allows you to send and receive messages from the GOV.UK Verify hub.

To set up the VSP locally, you should configure it and make sure it can correctly send and receive messages from the GOV.UK Verify Hub in all the [required scenarios][scenarios].

You can test your VSP works properly using the Compliance Tool.

The GOV.UK Verify team will ask about Compliance Tool testing results ahead of connecting to the Integration environment.
