# Handling the identity datset

This page offers guidance on things you should consider if you need to link a user's verified identity to information your service already holds.

## The identity dataset

When a user's identity is successfully verified, your service receives an identity dataset which contains verified information about that user including their:

- name
- address
- date of birth

The identity dataset may also include additional data such as historical addresses and gender.

To be able to receive the identity dataset, as a minimum requirement, your service should be able to [handle the successful verification user journey][successful-verification].

## Matching

If you need to check whether the identity dataset can be linked to information held by your service, you will need to implement a process called 'matching'. For more detailed information about setting up matching, refer to the [matching guidance section][matching].

### Handling European identities

Intro and link to eIDAS section: https://www.docs.verify.service.gov.uk/legacy/matching-guidance/matching-dataset/#pid-and-matching-dataset

## Test your matching implementation

You should test that your matching implementation correctly handles the [level of assurance][loa] of your service. If you have an LOA2 service, you must not accept LOA2 identities. However, as an LOA1 service, you can accept LOA2 identities.

Your matching strategy should be able to handle variations on user attributes as well as historical attributes and European identities, if needed.

There is [documentation on testing the matching service][test-matching] and it mentions testing using both the testing service (compliance tool) and the matching service test tool.
**TODO** Is the old content ok? Do we still want to mention both?
**TODO** Using the new VSP functionality to test the matching strategy
