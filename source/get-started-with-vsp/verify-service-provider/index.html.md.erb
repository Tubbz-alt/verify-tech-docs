# Verify Service Provider

You can use the Verify Service Provider to:

- generate a SAML (AuthnRequest) request to send to the Verify Hub
- translate the SAML response from the Verify Hub into JSON

[Download the Verify Service Provider from GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-service-provider/releases).

You must host the Verify Service Provider on your own infrastructure. You can connect multiple services to one instance.
