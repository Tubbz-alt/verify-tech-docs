# Compliance Tool

The Compliance Tool allows you to test and prove that your service can respond appropriately to all of the response scenarios in a Verify journey.

## Initialise Compliance Tool

The Verify Service Provider (VSP) download package contains a `get started` script which automates the initialisation of Compliance Tool so you can focus on integrating your service with the VSP.

```
./get-started
```

This script:

- generates self-signed keys and certs
- starts the VSP with correct configuration (new keys correctly formatted and pointing to CT)
- initialises Compliance Tool
