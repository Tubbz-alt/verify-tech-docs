# Update your Verify Service Provider signing key and certificate

If you're using the Verify Service Provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using a custom service provider, [go to the section about updating service provider keys][sp-keys].

## Step 1. Get a new self-signed signing certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

## Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

To make GOV.UK Verify Hub use your new signing self-signed certificate, upload it to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool.

You will get an e-mail confirmation when the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your new signing certificate. Wait for this confirmation before moving to the next step.

## Step 3. Replace the old signing key

Once you receive the e-mail confirmation, you can be sure that GOV.UK Verify Hub trusts messages signed with your new VSP signing key. This means it's safe to remove the old signing key from your VSP configuration.

<%= warning_text('Wait for the deployment confirmation e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify Team before replacing the old signing key.') %>

To remove the old encryption key from the VSP configuration:

1. Replace the old signing key under `samlSigningKey` in the VSP configuration with the new key.
1. Restart the VSP to implement the configuration changes.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts messages signed with your new VSP signing key.

You don't need to let the GOV.UK Verify team know that the new key is live. GOV.UK Verify Hub will continue to trust the your old certificate for a week from the time you uploaded your new one or until the expiry date, whichever is closer.
