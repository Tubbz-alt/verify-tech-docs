# Update your service provider encryption key and certificate

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][vsp-keys].

If your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. It's therefore recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

## Step 1. Get a new self-signed encryption certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

## Step 2. Add the new encryption key pair

Add your new service provider private encryption key to your service provider. Your service can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.

## Step 3. Upload the new encryption certificate

Upload your new encryption certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool.

You will receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your encryption certificate.

## Step 4. Delete the old encryption key pair

Remove your old encryption key from your service provider configuration.

Your service provider now uses the new encryption key to decrypt SAML messages.
