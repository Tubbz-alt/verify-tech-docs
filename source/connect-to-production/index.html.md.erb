# Connect to Production

The Production environment is where you deploy your live end-to-end service. Itâ€™s a restricted environment for security reasons.

You can connect to the Production environment once your service can handle all the possible outcomes of end-to-end user journeys.

To access the Production environment:

1. [Generate self-signed certificates][get-first-certs-prod].
2. [Request environment access][get-env-access-production].
