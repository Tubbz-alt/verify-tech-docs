# Development in Integration

The integration environment is a production-sized deployment of the GOV.UK Verify hub. It's a restricted environment for security reasons.

The purpose of the integration environment is to make sure that your service operates with the GOV.UK Verify hub. The integration environment is designed to test full end-to-end flows and to showcase a working system. Each service usually has a single connection to the integration environment. 

## What do you need to do?

Before you access the integration environment, you should make sure your service passes [compliance tool tests](LINK).

To access the integration environment:

1. Obtain [signed certificates](LINK) for the integration environment from the appropriate IDAP certificate authority.

2. Provide additional details of your service in the '[Request access to an environment](LINK)' form.

In the integration environment, you'll run [end-to-end testing](LINK). On successful completion of end-to-end testing you'll access the production environment. To access the production environment use the same procedure as above.
