# Alternatives to the Verify Service Provider

If you choose to configure an off-the-shelf product or build your own Service Provider, you should [contact Verify](LINK) before starting any development work.

You must:

- understand [how SAML works with GOV.UK Verify](LINK)
- decide how to [add the SAML functionality to your service](LINK)
- implement certain functionality to ensure smooth interoperability with Verify

This means you must:

- consume Verify Hub signing certificates directly from the Verify Hub metadata
- consume MSA signing certificates metadata from your [Matching Service Adapter (MSA)](LINK) metadata, or support multiple MSA signing certificates directly in your service
- support multiple encryption keys for your service

You must also follow:

- '[Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-saml-20-profile)' – describes the SAML specifications you must respect to connect to the GOV.UK Verify hub
- '[Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile – Authentication Contexts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-profile-authentication-contexts)' – describes how the level of assurance is specified
- '[Identity Assurance Hub Service Profile – SAML Attributes](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-profile-saml-attributes)' – describes the matching dataset attributes and fraud event assertion attributes

The SAML profile used by GOV.UK Verify builds on the [OASIS documentation for the SAML 2.0 standard ](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#samlv2.0).
