# Testing your service provider

The Compliance Tool allows you to test and prove that your service can respond appropriately to all of the scenarios your service needs to be able to handle.

If you are not using the Verify Service Provider, testing your service provider with the Compliance Tool also ensures that the service you're building is compliant with the [SAML profile](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-assurance-hub-service-saml-20-profile). This guarantees that:

* your service will work with GOV.UK Verify
* user data will remain secure within the GOV.UK Verify federation

After running SAML compliance tests, you can run [end-to-end testing](LINK) in the integration environment.
