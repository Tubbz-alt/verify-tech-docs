# Trust model

GOV.UK Verify uses encryption and signing so that federation members can trust message exchange is secure.

Encrypting and signing messages makes sure:

- only the intended receiver can see the message
- the receiver knows who sent the message
- messages are not tampered with

Members of the GOV.UK Verify federation must maintain separate pairs of private keys and self-signed certificates for encryption and signing.

As a service connecting to GOV.UK Verify, you must maintain private keys and self-signed certificates for your [Verify Service Provider (VSP)][vsp-intro].

Services that started connecting to GOV.UK Verify before January 2019 are also responsible for keeping Matching Service Adapter certificates up to date. If you're running a custom service provider instead of the VSP, you must keep the service provider's certificates up to date.
