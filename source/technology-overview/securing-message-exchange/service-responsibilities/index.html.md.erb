# Service team responsibilities

GOV.UK Verify uses encryption and signing to secure message exchange.

As a service connected to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping signing and encryption certificates up to date

## Keep your certificates up to date

The [Verify Service Provider (VSP)][vsp-intro] handles encryption and signing for your service. You generate your first set of VSP encryption and signing keys and certificates when you first connect to the [Integration][get-cert-test] or [Production][get-cert-prod] environments.

Once connected, you must keep your VSP encryption and signing certificates up to date for all environments you're connected to.

If a VSP certificate expires while in use, your connection to that GOV.UK Verify environment breaks. For the Production environment, this means your users wonâ€™t be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

When a certificate is due to expire, you must renew it by following the corresponding key rotation process. For example, find out how to rotate your:

- [VSP encryption key][rotate-vsp-encryption]
- [VSP signing key][rotate-vsp-signing]

Services that started connecting to GOV.UK Verify before January 2019 are also responsible for keeping Matching Service Adapter certificates up to date. If you are running a custom service provider instead of the VSP, you must keep the service provider's certificates up to date.
