# Decide how to use GOV.UK Verify data

Your service may need to handle the data from GOV.UK Verify even if you donâ€™t want to match identities against the data you hold. For example, you could collect the data now to use it later **EXPLAIN MORE** or store the information as part of an audit requirement.

Your service might not need to handle user attributes at all. An identity confirmation might be enough for your users to access your service.

**Remember you must clearly explain to end users why you are collecting the data and what it will be used for.**
