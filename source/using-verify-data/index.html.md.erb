# Decide how to use GOV.UK Verify data

Your service may need to handle the data from GOV.UK Verify even if you donâ€™t want to match identities against the data you hold. For example,

you could collect the data now to use it later **EXPLAIN MORE**
fill in a form and submit it. For example, if Then a case worker comes and looks at the attributes then matches

the matching doesn't need to happen immediately

or store the information as part of an audit requirement. What DVSA do. Operator license certificate (check product page) takes attributes and uses them as the equivalent of a wet signature -- check with Julian

Your service might not need to handle user attributes at all. An identity confirmation might be enough for your users to access your service.

**Remember you must clearly explain to end users why you are collecting the data and what it will be used for.**
