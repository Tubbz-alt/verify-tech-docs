Your service may need to handle the data from GOV.UK Verify even if you donâ€™t want to link users to data you already have. For example, you could be collecting the data as part of an audit requirement or to forward it to a case worker.

**Remember you must clearly explain to end users why you are collecting the data and what it will be used for.**
