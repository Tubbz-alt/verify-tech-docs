# Run end-to-end tests

The Integration environment is a deployment of the GOV.UK Verify Hub with test identity providers which you should test your user journeys from end to end.

If your service needs to link identities received from Verify to your database, you should also test this.

## Tear down

After each integration test run, we recommend that you [delete the test users][delete-test-users]. Set up each integration test run with newly created test users.

When you've successfully completed testing in the integration environment, you must provide a full demonstration of all user journeys. This is one of the [outputs required at this stage](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage4/Stage4.html#stage-4) before moving on to [Stage 5 Production Onboarding](http://alphagov.github.io/identity-assurance-documentation/stage5/Stage5.html).
