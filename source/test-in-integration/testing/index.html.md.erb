# Testing in Integration

The integration environment accurately reflects hub behaviour in the production environment. You can use the integration environment to test complete user journeys, both success and failure scenarios.

We  advise you to do end-to-end testing in the integration environment as part of your continuous integration pipeline. For more information, see [Testing code](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/code-testing) in the Government Service Design Manual.

If you carry out penetration testing (pen testing) on your end-to-end system, you must not extend this to the GOV.UK Verify Hub domain. You must only run penetration tests on your own system. If you think you have a valid reason for running penetration tests in the GOV.UK Verify Hub domain, you must first [contact GOV.UK Verify support][contact].
