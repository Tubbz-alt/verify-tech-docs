# Send and receive messages from Verify

Your service must use a system to send SAML messages to the Verify Hub and receive SAML responses in return. This system is known as a Service Provider.

You can either:

- use the Service Provider built by Verify, known as the [Verify Service Provider](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-service-provider) (recommended)
- configure an off-the-shelf product to use as a Service Provider
- build your own Service Provider

Whichever option you choose, you must [run compliance tests](LINK) to check you can send and receive SAML messages successfully in all possible scenarios.
