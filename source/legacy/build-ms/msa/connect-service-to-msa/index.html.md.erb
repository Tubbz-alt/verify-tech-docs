# Connect your service provider to the MSA metadata

To integrate GOV.UK Verify into your service, you need to connect your service to the Matching Service Adapter (MSA) metadata.


The MSA metadata:

* indicates the URL where your service will send users with their authentication requests - this is the GOV.UK Verify hub

* lists one or more MSA signing certificates, so your service can validate messages that are sent by your MSA

* describes the MSA as an identity provider


The MSA metadata is located in your MSA at `/matching-service/SAML2/metadata`

Your service must poll the MSA metadata every 10 minutes.
