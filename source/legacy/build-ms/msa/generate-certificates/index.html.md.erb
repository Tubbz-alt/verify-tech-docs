# Keys and certificates

With the default configuration in `test-config.yml` the MSA needs the following keys and certificates:

* `test_primary_signing{.pk8,.crt}` - primary signing private key and certificate
* `test_secondary_signing{.pk8,.crt}` - secondary signing private key and certificate
* `test_msa_encryption_1{.pk8,.crt}` - primary encryption private key and certificate
* `test_msa_encryption_2{.pk8,.crt}` - secondary encryption private key and certificate

The MSA needs primary and secondary keys to support [key rotations][msa-rotate-keys] without causing service downtime for users.
