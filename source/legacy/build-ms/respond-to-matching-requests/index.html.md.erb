# Respond to matching requests

Your service must respond to JSON matching requests from the Matching Service Adapter (MSA). The MSA makes requests to the URLs specified in the [YAML configuration file][configure-your-msa-yaml]:

* `localMatchingService:` `matchUrl:`
* `localMatchingService:` `accountCreationUrl:` (if you're [creating new user accounts][msa-create-user-accounts] when a match is not found)


The MSA sends one matching request for both Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 to your local matching service. Below is a formatted example for a GOV.UK Verify identity using the [msa-universal-json-schema].

The matching request for a European identity will be formatted according to the [universal JSON schema][msa-universal-json-schema]. If you haven't enabled European identities in your MSA configuration, the matching request will be formatted using [the legacy JSON schema][msa-legacy-json-schema]. [Find out more about European identities and eIDAS][msa-eu-identities].

Your local matching service first runs cycle 0. If no match is found, it runs cycle 1. It then sends either a `match` or a `no-match` response to the MSA. This response corresponds to step 6 in the [SAML message flow][msa-saml-flow].

Below is a match response (it should have the status code 200 OK):

```sh
{"result":"match"}
```

Below is a no-match response (it should have the status code 200 OK):

```sh
{"result":"no-match"}
```

If youâ€™re using cycle 3 and your local matching service returned a `no-match` response to the MSA, the MSA sends a cycle 3 matching request. Below is a formatted example for a GOV.UK Verify identity using the [universal JSON schema][msa-universal-json-schema].

If no match is found on cycles 0, 1 and 3, you can [create a new account][msa-create-user-accounts] for the user.
