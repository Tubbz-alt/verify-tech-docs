# Update your service provider signing key and certificate

These instructions apply to you if you're using an alternative to the Verify Service Provider (VSP). If you're using the VSP, [see the instructions on updating your VSP signing key and certificate][vsp-signing].

1. Generate a new self-signed signing certificate for your service provider.
1. [Upload your new signing certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool](https://connecting-to-verify-prototype.herokuapp.com/self-serve/before-you-start-sp-signing).
1. Receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your signing certificate.
1. Replace the old private signing key with the new key on your service endpoint - your service provider now signs SAML messages with the new key.

You don't need to let the GOV.UK Verify team know that the new key is live. GOV.UK Verify Hub will continue to trust the your old certificate for a week from the time you uploaded your new one or until the expiry date, whichever is closer.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts SAML messages signed with your new service provider signing key.
