# Update your VSP signing key and certificate

These instructions apply to you if you're using the Verify Service Provider (VSP). If you're not using the VSP, [see the instructions on updating your service provider signing key and certificate][sp-signing].

1. Generate a new self-signed signing certificate for your VSP.
1. [Upload your new signing certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool](https://connecting-to-verify-prototype.herokuapp.com/self-serve/before-you-start-vsp-signing).
1. Receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your signing certificate.
1. Replace the old signing key under `samlSigningKey` in the VSP configuration with the new key.
1. Restart the VSP to implement the configuration changes. The VSP now signs SAML messages with the new key.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts SAML messages signed with your new VSP signing key.
