# Update your service provider encryption key and certificate

These instructions apply to you if you're using an alternative to the Verify Service Provider (VSP). If you're using the VSP, [see the instructions on updating your VSP encryption key and certificate][vsp-encryption].

If your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. It's therefore recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

1. Generate a new self-signed encryption certificate for your service provider.
1. Add your new service provider private encryption key to your service provider. Your service can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.
1. [Upload your new encryption certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool](https://connecting-to-verify-prototype.herokuapp.com/self-serve/before-you-start-sp-encryption).
1. Receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your encryption certificate.
1. Remove your old encryption key from your service.

Your service provider now uses the new encryption key to decrypt SAML messages.
