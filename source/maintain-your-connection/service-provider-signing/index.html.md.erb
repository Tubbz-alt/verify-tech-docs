# Service provider

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][vsp-keys].

## Update the encryption key and certificate

If your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. It's therefore recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

### Step 1. Get a new self-signed encryption certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

### Step 2. Add the new encryption key pair

Add your new service provider private encryption key to your service provider. Your service can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.

### Step 3. Upload the new encryption certificate

Upload your new encryption certificate to the [GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool][manage-certs].

You will receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your encryption certificate.

### Step 4. Delete the old encryption key pair

Remove your old encryption key from your service provider configuration.

Your service provider now uses the new encryption key to decrypt SAML messages.

## Update the signing keys and certificate

### Step 1. Get a new self-signed signing certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

### Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

Upload your new signing certificate to the [GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool][manage-certs].

You will get an e-mail confirmation when the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your new signing certificate. Wait for this confirmation before moving to the next step.

### Step 3. Replace the old signing key pair

Replace the old private signing key with the new key on your service endpoint - your service provider now signs SAML messages with the new key.

You don't need to let the GOV.UK Verify team know that the new key is live. GOV.UK Verify Hub will continue to trust the your old certificate for a week from the time you uploaded your new one or until the expiry date, whichever is closer.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts SAML messages signed with your new service provider signing key.
