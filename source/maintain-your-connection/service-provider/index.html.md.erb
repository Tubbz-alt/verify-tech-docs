# Service provider

These instructions apply to you if you're using an alternative to the Verify Service Provider (VSP). If you're using the VSP, [see the instructions on updating your VSP keys][vsp-keys].

## Update the encryption key and certificate

If your service provider does not support dual running for your encryption keys, there will be a small outage when you update the encryption key. It's therefore recommended you do the update during periods of low traffic for your service.

1. Generate a new self-signed encryption certificate for your service provider.
1. Add your new service provider private encryption key to your service provider. Your service can now use both the new and old keys to decrypt SAML messages.
1. [Upload your new encryption certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool](https://connecting-to-verify-prototype.herokuapp.com/self-serve/before-you-start-sp-encryption).
1. Receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your encryption certificate.
1. Remove your old encryption key from your service.

Your service provider now uses the new encryption key to decrypt SAML messages.

## Update the signing key and certificate

1. Generate a new self-signed signing certificate for your service provider.
1. [Upload your new signing certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Service Admin tool](https://connecting-to-verify-prototype.herokuapp.com/self-serve/before-you-start-sp-signing).
1. Receive e-mail confirmation that the GOV.UK Verify team have deployed your signing certificate.
1. Replace the old private signing key with the new key on your service endpoint - your service provider now signs SAML messages with the new key.

You don't need to let the GOV.UK Verify team know that the new key is live. GOV.UK Verify Hub will continue to trust the your old certificate for a week from the time you uploaded your new one or until the expiry date, whichever is closer.

The GOV.UK Verify hub now trusts SAML messages signed with your new service provider signing key.
