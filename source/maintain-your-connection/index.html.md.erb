# Maintain your connection

Now that you are running GOV.UK Verify as part of your live service, you must ensure that you:

* [update your encryption and signing keys][rotate-keys] when needed
* keep your [Verify Service Provider][vsp-release] up to date

You can also keep up to date with the [status of GOV.UK Verify][status] by subscribing to updates.

## Updating your keys and certificates

When the certificates containing your public keys are due to expire, you must update them. If you don't, your users won't be able to access your service using GOV.UK Verify.

As a government service you are responsible for maintaining the encryption and signing keys and certificates for your service provider and Matching Service Adapter (MSA), if you are running one. Your service provider could be the [Verify Service Provider (VSP)](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-service-provider) or another service provider.

## Get new self-signed certificates

You can generate keys and self-signed certificates in many ways, but make sure they match the format that the Verify Service Provider and Matching Service Adapter use:

- PKCS#8 formatted keys `.pk8`
- PEM encoded X509 certificates `.crt`
