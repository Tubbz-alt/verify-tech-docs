# Service provider signing

If you built your own service provider to connect to GOV.UK Verify, you are responsible for keeping its encryption and signing certificates up to date.

If you're using the Verify Service Provider, [see how to update your Verify Service Provider keys][vsp-keys].

## Rotate your service provider signing key and certificate

### Step 1. Create a new self-signed signing certificate

<%= partial("partials/get-self-signed-certificates") %>

### Step 2. Upload the new signing certificate

Upload your new signing certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service.

This starts a deployment process that adds your new service provider signing certificate to the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration.
When the deployment is complete, the GOV.UK Verify Hub will be using both your new and your old certificate to check the signature on messages coming from your service.

The deployment process takes approximately 1 hour. You will receive e-mail confirmation when the GOV.UK Verify Hub starts using your new encryption certificate. You can also check the deployment status on the [GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service dashboard][dashboard].

Wait for this confirmation before moving to the next step.

### Step 3. Replace the old signing key

The e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify team confirms that GOV.UK Verify Hub now trusts messages signed with your new VSP signing key. This means you can replace the old signing key from your VSP configuration.

<%= warning_text('Wait for the deployment confirmation e-mail from the GOV.UK Verify Team before replacing the old signing key.') %>

Replacing your old private signing key with the new key means your service now signs messages for the GOV.UK Verify Hub using your new key.

### Step 4. Remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration

To make sure the GOV.UK Verify Hub doesn't trust messages signed with your old  key, you must also remove your old certificate from the GOV.UK Verify Hub configuration.

1. Go to the [GOV.UK Verify Manage certificates service dashboard][dashboard].
1. Select the service provider signing certificate due to expire.
1. Select **Stop using this certificate**.

The GOV.UK Verify Hub now only trusts messages signed with your new service provider signing key.
